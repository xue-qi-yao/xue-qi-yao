Hi! Iâ€™m Qiyao Xue, currently a second year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. Before that, I obtained by bachelor degree with first class honor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University major in Electrical Engineering and minor in Applied Mathematics.

My research interest lies in multimodal generative AI, bridging language, vision, and audio that move toward world models capable of perceiving, reasoning, and generating across modalities.
